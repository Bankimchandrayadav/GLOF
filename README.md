Hanging glacier avalanche (Raunthigad - Rishiganga) and Debris flow disaster of 7th February 2021, Uttarakhand, India, A Preliminary assessment

- A catastrophic debris flow in the Rishiganga and Dhauli ganga river in Uttarakhand, India on 7th February 2021 left a trail of disaster. 
- Around 200 people lost their lives, two hydro-power project were badly damaged and a bridge across the Rishiganga River was washed off in the event. 
- Study shows that the debris flow is caused due detachment of 0.59 km2 right lobe of a hanging glacier and resultant ice-rock avalanche. 
- Flood modeling study suggest a flood volume of ~â€‰10 MCM generating 24.5 m flow depth at the bridge site with 12.7 m/s flow velocity.
